This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a TypeScript function designed to compare two number arrays for equality. The function correctly identifies arrays with different values, but it fails to handle arrays of different lengths.  This example highlights the importance of thorough testing and edge case consideration when writing comparison functions. The solution demonstrates how to improve the code to handle different length arrays and return the correct boolean value.
